# WeatherApp

## Description

- Developers are the bridge between data and innovation. External APIs, like OpenWeather, open a world of opportunities to fetch real-time data and turn it into something meaningful. This week, challenge yourself to transform raw API responses into a sleek, user-friendly weather dashboard that brings weather data to life right in the browser.
- Every successful API call is a step toward mastering integration, problem-solving, and creativity. Push your limits, dive into documentation, and create a tool that delivers clarity and utility for all users.
- üöÄ Server-Side Power: Use the fs module to read and write to a searchHistory.json file, giving your app memory to store and retrieve cities.
